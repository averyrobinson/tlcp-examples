# tlcp-examples
feel free to send me like...those requests to push or whatever github does. I forget how this site works.

also if you know how to write "fix" or even how to add these inductively defined numbers without recursion please let me know I can't figure it out :(

files so far:
err-bools.tlcp -- uses error stuff to make booleans. returns NONE (as unit)
err-medium.tlcp -- I thought this was "medium" difficulty but I haven't written anything harder. Uses a lot of the grammar but doesn't do anything cool. returns 1
nat-bools.tlcp -- uses nats to make booleans. probably the easiest one. returns 0
